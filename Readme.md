# Keyboard on JS"

The On-Screen Keyboard Project is a small web page that allows users to interact with a virtual on-screen keyboard. It can be useful in situations where a physical keyboard does not work or is not available, but you need to enter text. 

**USING**

After the page loads, a text box will appear on the screen where you can start typing from the physical keyboard or using the on-screen keyboard. When you click on the input field, a virtual keyboard appears.

The virtual keyboard includes letters, numbers, punctuation marks, a space bar, a "Backspace" key to delete the last character, and a "Caps Lock" key to switch between capital letters. When you press the buttons on the on-screen keyboard, the corresponding character is added to the text field.

**FEATURES**

Caps Lock: The "Caps Lock" key allows you to switch the mode of capital letters. When "Caps Lock" mode is enabled, all entered characters will be displayed in upper case.

Backspace: The "Backspace" key allows you to delete the last entered character from the text field. Just press this key and the last character will be deleted.

Space: To add a space to your text, simply press the key labeled "Space".

Important notes
Make sure your browser supports JavaScript, as the virtual keyboard depends on it to function.
If your physical keyboard is working fine, you can also type using it. The on-screen keyboard is only intended for situations where a physical keyboard is not available or does not work. **
